QUIZALCOATL: DESCRIPTION
Welcome to our Snake Trivia App! Sign in and the game will initialize. You will receive a trivia question. Take some time to thing about the answer,  then eat the letters that spell it out. Be careful though, crashing into a wall or your tail will cause you to loose a life. In addition, every time you eat a letter your tail will grow and your speed will increase.
